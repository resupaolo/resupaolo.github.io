<h3>LANGUAGE</h3>
	<div class="about">
		<p id="2">For more than three centuries, Spanish served as the country's official language. In the early 20th century, it was the primary, second, or third language used by 60% of the populace. However, with American control in the early 1900s, Spanish usage started to drop. English and Spanish were designated as the official languages of the Philippines in the 1935 Constitution. The Tagalog language was selected as the national tongue in 1939. In 1959, the language was renamed "Pilipino," then in 1973, it was renamed "Filipino." English and Filipino are designated as shared official languages in the current Constitution.

Filipino culture is visible everywhere you go and has generally been valued and even praised in many areas of the world.

	<div class="about">
		<p id="6">One of the most cherished holidays in the Philippines is Christmas. On December 24, families and friends get together to savor meals made for "Noche Buena," a Spanish phrase that translates to "midnight dinner" to welcome Christmas Day.

	<h3>FAMILY STRUCTURE</h3>
	<div class="about">
		<img src="about/family.png">
		<p id="7">The family is the fundamental social unit of the nation, which also includes extended family (aunts, uncles, grandparents, cousins) and other outside relationships (godparents and close friends). As a result, many kids have many godparents, and grandparents typically take care of kids when their parents have to travel for business.  Members of the same family frequently work for the same business, a practice popularized by the first Chinese immigrants to the Philippines. Filipino families reside in various housing types depending on their position or location. Families in rural regions reside in nipa huts constructed of bamboo with corrugated metal roofs or palm leaves for walls. The "middle-class" Filipinos live in homes built of bricks and stones.

		<p>Even though their small stature may not make it clear, Filipinos are tremendous eaters. Because of the distinctiveness and variety of its cuisine, the Philippines is referred to be Asia's melting pot. Filipinos are unable to eat without rice on any given day. They enjoy eating pork, chicken, and salted fish with simple rice. The several foods they have learned to make and consume are served after the rice.
