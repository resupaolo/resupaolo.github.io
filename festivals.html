	<h3>FESTIVALS</h3>
	<p>Filipinos all over the world are known to like gathering and celebrating holidays. Just have a look at this extensive collection of Filipino festivities. We wouldn't be shocked if there was at least one fiesta or celebration in a town somewhere in the nation on each given day of the year, considering that this is only a partial list. Philippine festivals, which may last anywhere from a day to a whole month, are significant cultural events that draw both domestic and foreign visitors because of their vibrant and celebratory atmosphere.

The centurions' helmets, known as Morion, and the dressed-up penitents acting out the hunt for St. Longinus, known as Moriones, are two different concepts.</p>
